## Requirements:
* python==3.7.9
* CUDA==11.2
* torch==1.3.1
* torchvision==0.2.1
* opencv_python==4.2.0.34
* metric_learn==0.5.0
* six==1.12.0
* h5py==2.9.0
* scipy==1.3.1
* numpy==1.17.2
* Pillow==7.2.0
* scikit_learn==0.23.2
* SYSU-MM01 and RegDB dataset.
* faiss-gpu==1.6.0

## Preparing Data

* Clone our repo

SYSU-MM01 (RegDB the same):
* Download "SYSU-MM01.zip".
* Create a new directory, rename it as "data".
* Create a directory called "raw" under "data" and put "SYSU-MM01.zip" under it.
* The final structure should like this (meta.json and splits.json are generated by our code, please ignore them):
